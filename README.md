# Simulation of STM32 Based Embedded Systems

## AIM:
To draw the schematic and simulate the embedded system for the given requirement.

## REQUIREMENT:

## STEPS:
1.We start by designing the circuit in Proteus.

2.3 switches, 1 push button and a pair of LEDs are used for each.

3.The necessary connections are made out to complete the flow from Inputs (switch) to the Outputs (LEDs).

4.Once the entire layout has been designed, we move to coding the Microcontroller.

5.In STM32CubeIDE we configure the necessary pins as GPIO Input and Output pins.

6.Then we use a logical counter to blink the LEDs according to their respective frequencies.

7.After coding all the ports, we build the project and load the .elf file onto the simulator.
